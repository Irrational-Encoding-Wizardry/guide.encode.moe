# Masking using PS and AI

## Preface

<div class="info box"><p>

Most of the *Masking With Adobe Photoshop (PS) & Adobe Illustrator (AI) guide*
is written by **[gsk\_][]**.
If you see any pronouns such as "I", "me", "my", etc.,
unless otherwise stated,
it refers to me.

Before we get to know on how to work with AI,
I would like to give a small warning.
AI is a really advanced, powerful tool for typesetting
and if you use it carelessly
it may cause _Exploooooooooooosion.gif_
since its results are **heavy** to render
and take a toll on toasters.
This is something to always keep in mind,
so make sure you use it in _moderation_
and try to avoid whenever you can.

My aim of writing this guide
is to show basics of Photoshop, Illustrator and their relevant parts/features
and give you some direction on to how to use them.
Throughout the guide, I will be abbrevating
**Photoshop** as **PS** and Adobe **Illustrator** as **AI**.

I assume you have all the software installed and ready to go
And I also assume you know the basics of Aegisub,
so I will be skipping detailed explanation of it.
If you don't, I implore you to read the infamous [unanimated guide][].
